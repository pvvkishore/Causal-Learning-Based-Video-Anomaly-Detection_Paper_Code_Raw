## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvvkishore/Causal-Learning-Based-Video-Anomaly-Detection_Paper_Code_Raw.git
   cd Causal-Learning-Based-Video-Anomaly-Detection_Paper_Code_Raw
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .[dev]  # Install in development mode with dev dependencies
   ```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Example:

```python
def compute_anomaly_score(
    features: np.ndarray,
    threshold: float = 0.5
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Compute anomaly scores from features.
    
    Args:
        features: Input features of shape (N, D)
        threshold: Classification threshold
        
    Returns:
        Anomaly scores of shape (N,)
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Run the demo script to ensure basic functionality:
   ```bash
   python src/demo.py
   ```

2. Test on sample data if possible

3. Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update configuration examples if needed
- Add usage examples for new functionality

## Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

Example:
```
Add temporal attention visualization

- Implement attention weight heatmap plotting
- Add save functionality for attention maps
- Update visualization utilities

Fixes #123
```
